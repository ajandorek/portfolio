            <h1 className='text-center page-title'>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Alec Jandorek and I am an aspiring Web Developer. I was born and raised in Stamford, CT and spent my formative years there. After I graduated from high school, I shipped of to school at Bryant University in Smithfield, RI. While at Bryant, I majored in Marketing with a dual minor in Computer Information Systems and Communications. During my tenure at Bryant I was fortunate enough to intern at Bobbi Brown Cosmetics for a few summers. I also had the opportunity to study abroad in London. While overseas, I utilized my time outside the classroom to explore the continent. When all was said an done I had traveled to 15 different countries and countless cities. The experience really got me into traveling which is one of my current favorite hobbies. I hope to one-day travel to all the continents and visit a ton of other countries. </p>
            <p>After I graduated in the Spring of 2014 I packed my bags and headed down to Austin, TX where I currently reside. I got my first job shortly after moving down at Yodle, a marketing agency. During my two years at Yodle, I won countless awards such as Client Services Team Member of the Month, City of Champions (a quarterly award for excellence), and President’s Club, which included a trip to Cancun. After two years however, I decided I needed a change. I moved over to Workplace Answers, which is a compliance training company. In my current position I am a sort of “Jack of all Trades” marketer. My current responsibilities include writing blogs, managing social media, working in SalesForce, tradeshow management, and other ad-hoc projects.</p>
            <p>I also recently graduated from the Coding Bootcamp at UT Austin. This is a web development bootcamp that covers various front and back end frameworks such as Javascript, NodeJS, and SQL just to name a few. At the culmination of this bootcamp, I hope to land a job as a web developer and further my career. I think my background in marketing gives me a great perspective on what would work well on the web.</p>
